	2.	Clarify purpose: make it explicit this subfolder contains only outputs produced by OpenAI agent microsteps.
	3.	Partitioning rule: outputs must be partitioned by year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/ using event_time.
	4.	Metadata linkage: each run must update metadata_V1.yaml with event_time, ingest_time, provenance, and file hashes.
	5.	Security note: outputs must be immutable, no secrets ever written here.

# Phase 01 ‚Äî Outputs (OpenAI Agent)

## Purpose
This subfolder stores all **execution outputs generated by the OpenAI agent** during Phase 01.  
It inherits global rules from:
- `../README.md` (Outputs root)  
- `../../README.md` (Phase01_DAUL_Agent)  
- Root project `README_V1.md`

## Layout

Outputs/openai/
‚îú‚îÄ logs/           # stdout logs, JSONL captures
‚îú‚îÄ artifacts/      # hash-stamped generated files
‚îú‚îÄ reports/        # summaries, scan results, SBOMs
‚îî‚îÄ metadata_V1.yaml

## Evidence & Partitioning
All OpenAI outputs must be written under dated partitions by **event_time**:

Outputs/openai/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/

## Required metadata fields (`metadata_V1.yaml`)
```yaml
schema_version: 1.0.0
phase_id: 01
component: outputs-openai
scope: [logs, artifacts, reports]
timestamps:
  event_time: <ISO8601>
  ingest_time: <ISO8601>
provenance:
  source_session_id: <id>
  generated_files:
    - path: <relative_path>
      sha256: <hash>
privacy:
  pii_present: false
  redaction_status: "not_required"
status: initialized

Security
	‚Ä¢	No secrets or .env values are written here.
	‚Ä¢	All outputs are immutable once generated; new runs create new files + new hashes.

Usage
	1.	Each microstep execution writes its artifacts into this folder.
	2.	Each artifact is hashed (SHA256) and appended to PhaseLog.jsonl.
	3.	Metadata is updated with event_time + ingest_time.

Rule: This folder is the authoritative store of OpenAI agent outputs for Phase 01.

Would you like me to prepare the same correction for the **Docker Outputs** subfolder README next, so both OpenAI and Docker outputs stay perfectly aligned?
